Notes:
- difficult to separate hate speech from other instances of offensive language
- hate speech = speech that targets disadvantaged groups in a manner that is potentially harmul to them
- fine-grained labels help with hate speech detection
- subtle linguistic distinctions can make the difference between hate speech and other offensive language (or even non-hate speech)
- generic syntactic structure : <intensity> <user intent> <hate targets>
- neural language models show promise for detecting hate speech
- logistic regression with L2 and linear SVMs did a better job
- scikit-learn
- hate speech: it can be directly send to a person or group of people targeted, it can be espoused to nobody in particular, and it can be used in conversation between people
- deep learning architecture with multi-task learning
- 3 neuronal network models
- MultiCNN, multiple convolution structure with a trainable embedding layer
- the performance of the neural networks-based systems as well as the other approaches do not seem to differ much
